    "## Introduction\n",
    "Constraint Satisfaction is a technique for solving problems by expressing limits on the values of each variable in the solution with mathematical constraints.  We've used constraints before -- constraints in the Sudoku project are enforced implicitly by filtering the legal values for each box, and the planning project represents constraints as arcs connecting nodes in the planning graph -- but in this lab exercise we will use a symbolic math library to explicitly construct binary constraints and then use Backtracking to solve the N-queens problem (which is a generalization [8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![8-queens puzzle solution](8queens.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the 8-queens problem asks you to place 8 queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that none of the queens are in \"check\" (i.e., no two queens occupy the same row, column, or diagonal). The N-queens problem generalizes the puzzle to to any size square board.\n",

    "## II. Representing the N-Queens Problem\n",
    "Before implementing the board class, we need to construct the symbolic constraints that will be used in the CSP.  There are many acceptable ways to represent the N-queens problem, but one convenient way is to recognize that one of the constraints (either the row or column constraint) can be enforced implicitly by the encoding.  If we represent a solution as an array with N elements, then each position in the array can represent a column of the board, and the value at each position can represent which row the queen is placed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the column constraint is now handled, we only need a constraint to make sure that no two queens occupy the same row, and one to make sure that no two queens occupy the same diagonal."

    "- `diffRow` - generate constraints that return True if the two arguments do not match\n",
    "- `diffDiag` - generate constraints that return True if two arguments are not on the same diagonal (Hint: you can easily test whether queens in two columns are on the same diagonal by testing if the difference in the number of rows and the number of columns match)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both generators should produce binary constraints (i.e., each should have two free symbols) once they're bound to specific variables in the CSP.  For example, Eq((a + b), (b + c)) is not a binary constraint, but Eq((a + b), (b + c)).subs(b, 1) _is_ a binary constraint because one of the terms has been bound to a constant, so there are only two free variables remaining.
